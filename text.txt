Created endpoint to retrieve user's phone number

Pull Request Description:
A new GET endpoint /api/user/phone has been created to allow users to retrieve their associated phone number.
The following rules and considerations were established:

Implemented logic to return the user's associated phone number.
Only users with an active session in the system can request their phone number.
Handled cases where a user does not have an active session, returning a 403 status code.
Managed the situation where the user's phone number does not exist, returning a 404 error with the appropriate message.
Obtained the user's session ID from the system's cookies and performed the information query based on that key, which is stored in Redis.




Title of the Pull Request:
Created endpoint to request calls to Serlefin with user authentication and error handling

Pull Request Description:
A new POST endpoint /api/user/call has been created to allow the reception of a user's phone number as parameters. Additionally, the Serlefin service has been integrated based on the provided documentation.

The following rules and considerations were established:

Created an endpoint to receive the user's phone number.
Integrated the Serlefin provider.
Handled cases where a user does not have an active session, returning a 403 status code.
If the endpoint fails while processing a request to make a call via Serlefin, the request is retried up to 3 times.
If the API fails after 3 attempts, a 403 status code is returned.
